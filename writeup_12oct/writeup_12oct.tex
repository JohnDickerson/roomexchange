To compile this, you'll need to download and install a Latex distribution.  On a Mac, I'd recommend \url{https://tug.org/mactex/}.  On Windows and Linux, I'd probably recommend \url{http://miktex.org/}.

This is how you cite papers:~\cite{Jevons85:Money}.  The information for those citations can be found in the \texttt{refs.bib} file in this directory.

\subsection*{Notes from Ryan Sachs}

Being Done Right Now:
\begin{itemize}
\item Pairs of roommates get swapped
\end{itemize}

Basic Requirements:
\begin{itemize}
\item Extend the roommate swapping to handle personal preferences and more than just pairs of people
\item Implement an optimal solution to the above
\item Implement a website to handle the swapping problem
\end{itemize}

Formalize what we don't know.
\begin{itemize}
\item What is reslife doing?
\item What exactly are we trying to solve?
\item How will we determine preferences/swapping?
\end{itemize}
